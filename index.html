    <h2>Baking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li> <br>

                <li><strong>For the crust:</strong> Melt the butter, covered in the microwave, in a medium microwave-safe bowl, or a saucepan. Brush a 9-inch springform pan with some of the butter. Stir the remaining butter together with the almond flour and golden monk fruit. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly around the edges. Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 - 20 minutes. Cool. Wrap the bottom and up the sides of the pan with foil and put in the dutch oven or casserole dish.</li><br>

                <li><strong>For the filling:</strong> Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature, so it is soft. Beat the softened cream cheese on medium speed with a hand-held mixer until smooth. Add the granulated monk fruit and beat at a medium to low speed until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl and beaters as needed. Slowly beat in the sour cream, then eggs, vanilla, cream, and lemon juice;  DO NOT OVER MIX. <strong>Wrap the outside bottom of the pan in tin foil, a little past halfway ( this is to prevent the water from seeping into the cheesecake pan).</strong> Pour filling into the cooled crust.</li><br>

                <li><strong>Baking Set Up:</strong> Bring a medium saucepan or kettle of water to a boil. Place the pan containing the uncooked cheesecake, with the bottom wrapped in a layer of tinfoil, into a Dutch Oven/casserole dish. Pour the hot water into the large casserole dish until it is about 1- ish inches deep, but not above the tinfoil. Gently place the Dutch Oven (uncovered) with the water and springform pan containing the cheesecake in the oven (don't pull the rack out of the oven). <strong>Bake the cheesecake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes</strong>---the outside of the cake will set but the center will still be loose.</li><br>

                <li><strong>For the topping:</strong>  Stir together the sour cream, powdered monk fruit sweetener, and vanilla. Gently spread over the top of the cooked cheesecake and return to the oven for 5 minutes.<em>Then </em> the oven off, put the lid on the Dutch Oven and cook the cheesecake in the residual heat in the oven for an additional hour. This gentle finish minimizes the risk of the feared cracking in your cheesecake. If you are using a casserole dish then just turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake uncovered in the oven</li><br>

                <li>Remove cheesecake from the water bath and place it on a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edges and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Then cut and serve.</li>
